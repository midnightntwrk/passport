## Abstract

This MIP specifies the multi-key account standard for Midnight custody
contracts: who may release an account's assets, how that authority is
proven, and how it is granted, revoked, and rotated across a set of
independent device keys. It is the second building block of the
multi-key account contract recommended by MPS-0018, and it instantiates
the authorisation seam that the Contract Custody of Midnight-Native
Assets MIP (hereafter "the custody MIP") deliberately left abstract.

Authorisation is by digital signature: each device holds an independent
Schnorr keypair on the JubJub curve, and every asset-releasing circuit
verifies, in-circuit, a signature over a challenge that binds the
account, the circuit, its arguments, and a per-account authorisation
counter. The choice of an asymmetric signature scheme over the cheaper
hash-preimage alternative is deliberate, and carries the standard's
three load-bearing properties. First, Schnorr admits the FROST
threshold-signing protocol, so a key can be held as shares across an
MPC committee that never reconstructs it — the composability with
threshold custody that MPS-0018 records as broken at the proving
boundary. Second, JubJub is the embedded curve of Midnight's proof
system, so the curve arithmetic of verification — `ecMulGenerator`,
`ecMul`, `ecAdd` — is native in-circuit, with no foreign-field
emulation; the challenge hash is the standard library's
version-stable persistent hash (Rationale R3). Third, a signature
separates approval from
proving: the party that authorises an operation produces a short
artefact and needs no Midnight stack, while the party that proves needs
the artefact and not the credential, so key custody and proof
generation can live in different trust domains.

The scheme has been validated end to end on a devnet node, with
independent TypeScript and Rust signers producing interchangeable
signatures against the same in-circuit verifier. The device set carries
an epoch mechanism that revokes every stale authorisation in one step,
and a recovery seam, left abstract here, for the recovery-paths MIP
recommended by MPS-0018.

## Motivation

MPS-0018 frames the problem: Midnight has no ratified model for an
on-chain account that custodies and authorises a user's native assets
under multi-key, multi-device control while satisfying lost-device
recovery, total-loss recovery, and key non-exfiltration at once. The
custody MIP delivered the asset half of the recommended keystone: how a
contract holds and releases value, with every release gated by a single
abstract seam, `require_authorised()`, whose observable semantics it
fixes and whose credential scheme it deliberately does not. This
document is the companion "instantiating standard" its section 1
anticipates: it supplies the credential scheme and the key-management
lifecycle, and nothing in the custody rules changes underneath it.

Three specific inadequacies motivate the scheme chosen here.

**Threshold custody has nothing to attach to.** MPS-0018 records that
threshold-signature MPC does not compose with proving: shielded and
contract operations are authorised by proof generation, the secret
enters the proof as a witness, and the witness must be assembled in one
place to prove — reintroducing the single point of key exposure that
MPC exists to remove. MPS-0024 raises the institutional form of the
same gap: custodian control frameworks are built around signature
ceremonies, and Midnight's proof-authorised asset movement bypasses
them. An account whose seam verifies a *signature* inverts this: the
nodes of a threshold committee jointly produce the signature, the
circuit verifies it, and no step requires the key — or even a key
share — to reach the proving machine.

**Hash-preimage authorisation binds the credential to the prover.** The
cheapest seam instantiation, and the one the account-custody prototype
used as a placeholder, gates circuits on knowledge of a committed
32-byte secret. The witness *is* the long-term credential: whoever
generates the proof holds it, whole, for every authorised call. That
excludes threshold custody structurally, makes delegated proving
(MPS-0004) equivalent to handing over the account, and turns every
proving environment into key-custody infrastructure.

**Upstream caller identity is unsettled and single-key.** In-circuit
verification of native address ownership has been requested in the
token-standards discussion, a stdlib caller-identity primitive has been
proposed, and MPS-0010 and MPS-0011 (the problem statements on
signature verification and native crypto primitives) frame the wider
demand. A caller identity derived from ledger-scheme keys binds
authority to a single secp256k1 key rather than to an account policy,
cannot authenticate shielded callers, and does not compose with a
threshold scheme on another curve (custody MIP, section 4). An account
standard needs authority to attach to a *policy over a device set*,
not to one wallet key — and it needs it on a curve the circuit can
afford.

The absence of any standard here has a demonstrated cost: contracts in
the wild authenticate callers with `ownPublicKey()`, which is
wallet-supplied and unverified, and the attack has been reproduced
against deployed examples. The upstream position is that the primitive
was never intended for authentication; the safe pattern — verify a
signature in-circuit against a stored key — is exactly what this MIP
standardises.

## Specification

The key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, and MAY are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### 1. Terminology

- **Account**: a custody contract instance conforming to the custody
  MIP whose authorisation seam this standard instantiates.
- **Device**: a key-holding party able to authorise account operations:
  a phone, a laptop, a hardware module, or a threshold committee
  presenting a single group key (section 7).
- **Device key**: an independent Schnorr keypair `(sk, pk = sk·G)` on
  the JubJub curve. Device keys are never derived from one another or
  from a shared seed.
- **Device commitment**: the domain-separated hash of a device public
  key, used as the key of the on-ledger device set.
- **Epoch**: a monotone counter over the device set; device entries are
  valid only if their recorded epoch equals the current one.
- **Authorisation counter** (`auth_nonce`): a monotone counter bound
  into every challenge; the freshness element of the custody MIP's
  seam semantics.
- **Challenge**: the scalar a signature is verified against, computed
  in-circuit over the call it authorises (section 5).

### 2. Curve and hash

The signature scheme is Schnorr over the JubJub curve with a challenge
computed by the Compact standard library's persistent hash:

- **Group.** The prime-order subgroup of JubJub, the twisted Edwards
  curve defined over the BLS12-381 scalar field. Its subgroup order is
  `r_J = 0x0e7db4ea6533afa906673b0101343b00a6682093ccc81082d0970e5ed6f72cb7`
  and its cofactor is 8. `G` is the generator used by Compact's
  `ecMulGenerator`.
- **Challenge hash.** Compact's `persistentHash`: SHA-256 over the
  compiler's field-aligned binary encoding of the typed preimage of
  section 5, recomputed in-circuit. This is a deliberate departure
  from RedJubjub as deployed elsewhere, which hashes with BLAKE2b-512
  (unavailable in-circuit), and a deliberate rejection of the cheaper,
  circuit-optimised `transientHash` (Poseidon-family), whose output
  the toolchain does not guarantee across upgrades. Both choices are
  argued in Rationale R3 and reviewed under Path to Active.
- **Scalar domain.** Signatures are computed modulo `r_J`. Because the
  hash output is a 32-byte value that may exceed `r_J`, signers
  grind a nonce until the challenge falls below `r_J` (section 5.2), so
  both sides of the verification equation operate on the same scalar.

Off-circuit signers MUST reproduce `persistentHash` bit-exactly,
including the Compact compiler's field-alignment encoding of the typed
preimage. This is demonstrably implementable outside the TypeScript
toolchain: the reference signers include a pure-Rust implementation
producing signatures interchangeable with the TypeScript one
(Implementation section).

### 3. Public ledger state

An account extends the custody MIP's ledger state (its section 3) with
the device set. This extension is of the kind the custody MIP permits:
no invariant of its section 7 is weakened, and no coin material is
recorded.

```compact
export ledger devices: Map<Field, Uint<32>>;
// device commitment -> epoch at registration.

export ledger device_epoch: Uint<32>;
// Bumped by recovery. Entries recorded under an older epoch are inert.

export ledger device_count: Uint<8>;
// Devices active in the current epoch. Guards the last-device rule.

export ledger auth_nonce: Uint<64>;
// Bumped by every seam-gated call, and only by seam-gated calls.
// Every challenge covers it (section 5); a signature authorises at
// most one call.
```

The device commitment for a public key `pk` is:

```compact
persistentHash<[Bytes<32>, JubjubPoint]>([DST_DEVICE, pk])
```

where `DST_DEVICE` is the domain-separation tag
`"midnight:account:device:v1"`, zero-padded to 32 bytes. All tags
introduced by this MIP are to be registered under the registry
recommended by MPS-0027.

The account is deployed with an initial device set of exactly one
commitment at epoch 0, `device_count = 1`, and `auth_nonce = 0`.

### 4. Seam instantiation

The custody MIP requires every asset-releasing circuit to be gated by
`require_authorised()` and fixes its observable semantics: the proof of
authority MUST bind to the circuit identity, its arguments, and a
freshness element the contract state advances, and a transferable
artefact such as a signature MUST cover the freshness element
explicitly. This section instantiates that seam.

A gated circuit takes, in addition to its own arguments, the
authorising material:

```compact
pk:          JubjubPoint,  // the signing device's public key
sig_r:       JubjubPoint,  // Schnorr commitment R = r·G
sig_s:       Field,        // Schnorr response s = r + c·sk (mod r_J)
grind_nonce: Uint<64>,     // challenge-grinding counter (section 5.2)
```

and performs, in order:

1. **Membership.** Compute the device commitment of `pk` (section 3);
   assert `devices.member(commitment)` and
   `devices.lookup(commitment) == device_epoch`.
2. **Challenge.** Recompute the challenge `c` over this call's preimage
   (section 5).
3. **Verification.** Assert `ecMulGenerator(sig_s) ==
   ecAdd(sig_r, ecMul(pk, c))`.
4. **Freshness.** Increment `auth_nonce`, and increment `round` per the
   custody MIP.

On any assertion failure the circuit aborts and no state changes. Any
active device is sufficient to authorise (1-of-n at the contract
surface); threshold policies live behind a single device entry
(section 7), and richer on-ledger policies (m-of-n across device
entries, scoped grants) are permitted extensions that interact only
with this seam and MUST NOT weaken any invariant of section 9.

The authorising material is witness data of the transaction's proof: it
appears in no public output, and MUST NOT be disclosed by the circuit.
The device commitment computed in step 1 is disclosed by the ledger
lookup itself; the consequences are bounded in Security Considerations
S4. Transport of the signature between signer and prover is
client-internal and out of scope: the circuit consumes the typed values
above, and no wire format is consensus-relevant.

### 5. Challenge construction

#### 5.1 Preimage

The challenge for a gated circuit is:

```compact
const h: Bytes<32> = persistentHash<[Bytes<32>, ContractAddress, JubjubPoint, JubjubPoint, ...Args, Uint<64>, Uint<64>]>(
  [DST_CIRCUIT, kernel.self(), sig_r, pk, ...args, auth_nonce, grind_nonce]
);
const c: Field = h as Field;
```

where:

- `DST_CIRCUIT` is a per-circuit domain-separation tag of the form
  `"midnight:account:auth:v1:<circuit-name>"`, zero-padded or hashed to
  32 bytes, distinct for every gated circuit and registered under the
  MPS-0027 registry. Distinct tags make signatures for one circuit
  unusable for any other, independent of argument encoding.
- `kernel.self()` is the account's own contract address. Its inclusion
  makes a signature for one account unusable against another account
  in which the same device key is registered.
- `...args` is the gated circuit's full argument list, excluding the
  authorising material itself, in declaration order, with their Compact
  types.
- `auth_nonce` is the current authorisation counter (pre-increment).

The preimage MUST include every element above. Implementations
SHOULD additionally bind a network identifier (the CAIP-2 identifier of
MIP-0008) where deployments may exist on more than one network;
inclusion is via the `DST_CIRCUIT` tag or an explicit element.

#### 5.2 Grinding

The signer computes `h` for `grind_nonce = 0, 1, 2, …` and uses the
first value whose little-endian integer interpretation is strictly less
than `r_J`. Since `r_J ≈ 2^251.85`, each attempt succeeds with
probability about 5.7%, and the expected number of attempts is about
17.5; the search is over public-to-the-signer data and reveals nothing
secret. The circuit recomputes the identical hash, so the `as Field`
cast (range-checked against the BLS12-381 scalar modulus, which
exceeds `r_J`) always succeeds for an honestly ground challenge, and
the scalar the circuit multiplies by equals the scalar the signer
signed with. Rejection sampling leaves the challenge distribution
uniform over `[0, r_J)`.

#### 5.3 Signing

To authorise a call, a device:

1. Samples a nonce scalar `r` uniformly from `[0, r_J)`. Nonce
   generation MUST ensure `r` is never reused across distinct
   challenges and never predictable; deterministic derivation in the
   manner of RFC 6979, hedged with randomness, is RECOMMENDED
   (Security Considerations S1).
2. Computes `R = r·G`.
3. Grinds the challenge per section 5.2 over the exact preimage of
   section 5.1, using the `auth_nonce` value the call will execute
   against.
4. Computes `s = r + c·sk mod r_J`.
5. Outputs `(R, s, grind_nonce)`.

Steps 1–2 and 4 require only JubJub scalar arithmetic; step 3 requires
SHA-256 and the field-alignment encoding of the preimage. A signer
therefore needs no Midnight node, indexer, prover, or contract
runtime — the property Rationale R5 builds on.

### 6. Device lifecycle

- `add_device(new_pk: JubjubPoint)` (gated): computes the commitment of
  `new_pk`, inserts `commitment -> device_epoch`, increments
  `device_count`. MUST fail if the commitment is already active in the
  current epoch.
- `remove_device(commitment: Field)` (gated): removes an active device
  entry. MUST fail if the commitment is not active in the current
  epoch, or if `device_count == 1` (AUTH-5). Decrements `device_count`.
- Lost-device response is `remove_device` from a surviving device.
  Compromised-device response is the same, and Security Considerations
  S7 bounds the exposure window.

Adding a device transfers no key material: the new device generates its
keypair locally and exports only `pk`. How `pk` reaches an existing
device (QR code, ceremony) is client behaviour, out of scope; clients
SHOULD authenticate the channel, since whoever's key is added gains
full 1-of-n authority.

### 7. Threshold devices (FROST profile)

The verifier of section 4 is deliberately threshold-agnostic: it checks
one Schnorr equation against one public key and does not know or care
whether `(R, s)` was produced by one signer or by a quorum. A
**threshold device** is a `t`-of-`n` committee registered as a single
device entry whose public key is the committee's joint key.

A conforming threshold device MUST satisfy:

- **Key generation.** The joint key is produced by a distributed key
  generation protocol (or by a trusted dealer who verifiably deletes
  the dealt key), such that no party ever holds the full private key.
- **Signing.** Signature shares are produced and aggregated in the
  manner of FROST (RFC 9591): each participant contributes a nonce
  commitment and a signature share computed from its key share; the
  coordinator aggregates shares into a single `(R, s)`. The full key is
  never reconstructed, at signing time or otherwise.
- **Ciphersuite.** The challenge MUST be computed exactly per section
  5: the coordinator aggregates the group commitment `R`, performs the
  grinding search of section 5.2 (grinding varies only `grind_nonce`,
  after `R` is fixed), and distributes the resulting challenge to
  participants. This constitutes a new FROST ciphersuite — JubJub with
  the section 5 challenge — and its specification and review are
  acceptance criteria under Path to Active, not deliverables of this
  document.

The account contract is unchanged under this profile; that is the
point. Committee-internal concerns — participant authentication, share
refresh, liveness — are the committee operator's, and an account MAY
mix threshold and single-signer devices freely.

### 8. Recovery seam

The contract MUST expose exactly one path that changes the device set
without an active device: a recovery circuit that (a) verifies a
recovery authorisation whose mechanism this MIP does not specify,
(b) increments `device_epoch`, (c) registers exactly one fresh device
commitment at the new epoch and sets `device_count` to 1, and
(d) increments `auth_nonce` and `round`.

Under contract custody, recovery restores asset access by construction:
assets sit in the contract, the epoch bump changes who may authorise,
and the custody MIP's inbox walk rebuilds the coin store from chain
data. The recovery authorisation mechanism is the subject of the
recovery-paths MIP recommended by MPS-0018 and MUST be specified there
before this seam is instantiated.

### 9. Invariants

A conforming implementation MUST satisfy all of the following, in
addition to the custody MIP's INV-1 through INV-8.

- **AUTH-1 (signature gate).** Every seam-gated circuit verifies a
  Schnorr signature per sections 4–5 against a device key active in
  the current epoch; no gated circuit proceeds on any other authority.
- **AUTH-2 (single use).** Every challenge covers `auth_nonce`, and
  every gated call increments it: a signature authorises at most one
  executed call.
- **AUTH-3 (full binding).** Every challenge covers the account
  address, the per-circuit tag, and the complete argument list: a
  signature authorises only the exact call it was computed for, on the
  exact account.
- **AUTH-4 (non-exfiltration).** No circuit and no conforming client
  flow requires a device private key, or a share of one, to leave the
  device that generated it. In particular, proof generation consumes
  the signature and never the signing key.
- **AUTH-5 (no lock-out by ceremony).** `remove_device` cannot remove
  the last active device.
- **AUTH-6 (revocation totality).** After an epoch bump, no credential
  recorded under a previous epoch can authorise any operation.
- **AUTH-7 (seedlessness).** Device keys are mutually independent; no
  flow requires a shared seed or derives one device's key from
  another's.
- **AUTH-8 (deposit independence).** Permissionless operations
  (deposits, inbox appends) do not read or advance `auth_nonce`; a
  third party's deposit cannot invalidate a pending authorisation
  (Rationale R4).

### 10. Versioning

- This specification is versioned by its MIP number and revision
  history; substantive changes after acceptance require a new MIP that
  lists this one in `Replaces`.
- The credential scheme specified here carries the identifier
  `midnight:account:auth:v1` (the prefix of every `DST_CIRCUIT` tag).
  A successor scheme — a different curve, hash, or policy structure —
  is a new tag prefix under a new or revising MIP; the domain
  separation of section 5.1 keeps artefacts of distinct schemes
  mutually unusable by construction.
- Implementations MAY record a scheme tag alongside the epoch in the
  device map to support future per-device scheme agility; under this
  MIP alone, all devices use the v1 scheme.

## Rationale

**R1. An asymmetric signature scheme, not a hash preimage.** A
hash-preimage gate is cheaper in-circuit — one hash evaluation
against three curve operations and a hash evaluation — and the
account-custody prototype used it as a placeholder for exactly that
reason. It was rejected as the standard because the preimage *is* the
credential, and that identity has three costs the signature scheme
removes:

| Property | Hash preimage | Schnorr over JubJub (this MIP) |
|---|---|---|
| Witness content | the long-term secret itself | a one-call signature |
| Threshold / MPC custody | structurally excluded — the whole secret must be assembled as one witness | native — FROST produces the same `(R, s)` from shares (section 7) |
| Delegated proving (MPS-0004) | delegate holds the account credential | delegate can execute at most the one approved call (S6) |
| Signer needs Midnight stack | prover and credential-holder are the same party | signer needs JubJub and SHA-256 only (5.3) |
| Compromise via proving environment | permanent — secret exposed on every call | bounded — key never enters the proving path (AUTH-4) |
| In-circuit cost | one hash | three native JubJub ops and one hash (R2, R3) |

The last row is the price and the first five are what it buys. The
custody MIP's seam semantics were written so that either scheme
satisfies them; this MIP standardises the signature scheme because the
account standard is precisely where threshold custody (MPS-0018,
MPS-0006, MPS-0016, MPS-0024) and proving delegation (MPS-0004) attach.

**R2. JubJub, not Ed25519 or secp256k1.** The candidate signature
schemes differ not in their algebra — all are Schnorr-family over a
prime-order group — but in what their group arithmetic costs inside a
BLS12-381 circuit:

| Curve | In-circuit arithmetic | Threshold story | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| JubJub | native — its base field is the BLS12-381 scalar field; `ecMul`, `ecAdd`, `ecMulGenerator` are Compact built-ins | FROST over any prime-order group; existing library support (Implementation) | validated on devnet |
| Ed25519 | non-native — base field `2^255 − 19` requires emulated field arithmetic, hundreds of constraints per field operation | FROST (RFC 9591 ciphersuite) | rejected: cost |
| secp256k1 (ECDSA) | non-native — the demand exists precisely because it is absent (MPS-0010) | ECDSA thresholdisation is substantially more complex than Schnorr's | rejected: cost and threshold complexity |
| Ledger-scheme caller identity (stdlib proposal) | n/a — verified outside the circuit | bound to a single ledger key; no account policy; cannot authenticate shielded callers | rejected: wrong attachment point (custody MIP §4) |

The curve-economics assessment was confirmed in cryptographer review
during the feasibility phase, and the JubJub path was then validated
empirically: the reference experiment verifies the section 4 equation
in a Compact circuit on a devnet node, through the standard proof
server, at interactive latencies. This MIP does not modify or compete
with MIP-0003, which governs ledger-level wallet keys (Schnorr and
ECDSA over secp256k1, verified by the node): those keys authenticate
transactions, this scheme authenticates *account operations* inside
circuit logic, and MIP-0003 itself places JubJub as the in-circuit
curve.

**R3. The persistent hash for the challenge — not BLAKE2b, and not the
cheaper transient hash.** Standard RedJubjub hashes its challenge with
BLAKE2b-512, which Compact circuits cannot evaluate; the challenge
must be recomputed *inside* the circuit — that is what binds the
signature to the call — so the scheme must use a hash the language
exposes, and there are two. `transientHash` is the circuit-optimised
one: an algebraic (Poseidon-family) compression to a field element,
markedly cheaper in-circuit than `persistentHash`, which is SHA-256
over the compiler's field-aligned binary encoding. This MIP
nevertheless specifies `persistentHash`, because the two differ in
their stability contract, and the stability contract is what a
standard is made of: the toolchain documents `transientHash` as *not
guaranteed to persist between upgrades* and unfit for deriving state
data, and `persistentHash` as guaranteed consistent between versions.
Three considerations make that decisive. Device commitments are
ledger state, where the custody MIP's hash discipline (its S6)
already requires cross-version stability — the account-custody
prototype used `transientHash` for its commitments and records
non-survival of a toolchain upgrade as an accepted prototype-only
caveat. A deployed account's circuit is frozen at deploy while its
signers are rebuilt continually, so a challenge hash that drifted
with the toolchain would strand every signer built after an upgrade.
And the signing side of this scheme is meant to be implemented
independently — in HSMs, in threshold committees, in codebases with
no Midnight toolchain at all — which requires a challenge function
with a fixed public definition; "whatever the current compiler emits"
cannot be profiled into a FROST ciphersuite or put in front of a
reviewer. SHA-256 is also the most widely available primitive in
exactly the constrained signers R5 contemplates. The price is paid
in-circuit, where SHA-256 costs far more than an algebraic hash; the
reference experiment carries that cost through a production proof
server at interactive latencies, so the trade is affordable, and the
curve arithmetic — the part JubJub was chosen for (R2) — is
unaffected. Should the toolchain later expose a version-pinned
algebraic hash, adopting it is a successor scheme under section 10:
cheaper verification, same architecture. The substitution of SHA-256
for BLAKE2b is sound in principle — Fiat–Shamir requires a
collision-resistant hash binding over the preimage — but it makes the
scheme a variant rather than an implementation of a deployed
standard, so independent cryptographer review of the challenge
construction (including the grinding of 5.2 and the scalar-domain
alignment) is an acceptance criterion, not a formality. The grinding
loop costs the signer ~17.5 hash evaluations in expectation,
negligible on any hardware; the alternative — reducing the hash
modulo `r_J` in-circuit — was rejected because the reduction is
itself circuit logic while grinding costs the circuit nothing.

**R4. A dedicated `auth_nonce`, not `round`.** The custody MIP's
`round` counter advances on *every* state-changing call, including
permissionless deposits and inbox appends. A signature bound to `round`
would be invalidated by any third-party deposit that lands between
signing and submission — for a threshold device, between the start of
a signing ceremony and the transaction's acceptance — turning
permissionless deposits into a griefing surface against authorisation
liveness. `auth_nonce` advances only on gated calls, so only the
account's own authorised activity can race a pending signature. Safety
is unaffected: `auth_nonce` is contract state the gated call itself
advances, satisfying the custody MIP's freshness requirement, and
AUTH-2 gives at-most-once execution.

**R5. Approval separated from proving.** Binding authorisation to a
verified signature rather than to witness-knowledge of a secret splits
the transaction pipeline into two roles with distinct trust
requirements. The *approver* holds key material and produces `(R, s,
grind_nonce)`; it needs JubJub arithmetic and SHA-256 and nothing
else — no node, no indexer, no prover, no contract artefacts — so it
can be an HSM-like device, a TEE, an air-gapped machine, or an MPC
committee, and it can render the operation for human review before
signing, in the manner of a hardware wallet. The *prover* holds the
signature and the circuit's other witnesses and produces the
transaction; by AUTH-2 and AUTH-3 the worst it can do with the
signature is execute the exact approved call once, or drop it. This is
the property that makes the scheme MPC-compatible (the committee is
just an approver), audit-friendly (approval is an explicit artefact a
control framework can gate, log, and require quorums for — the shape
MPS-0024 asks for), and compatible with delegated proving (MPS-0004)
without the delegate becoming a key custodian. The two reference
signers demonstrate the boundary concretely: the signing side runs as
a standalone binary with no Midnight dependency beyond the curve and
hash.

**R6. 1-of-n at the contract, thresholds inside a device entry.** The
contract-surface policy is deliberately minimal: any active device
authorises. Rich policy (m-of-n across entries, per-operation limits,
scoped grants) is layered, not baked in, for the same reason the
custody MIP kept the seam abstract: policy is where requirements
diverge — personal accounts, institutional custody, and agent identity
(MPS-0015) will not want the same one — and the FROST profile already
provides thresholds where they are cryptographically strongest, behind
one key, invisible to the ledger and to observers. An on-ledger m-of-n
extension remains possible against the same seam without revising this
standard.

**R7. Per-device keys, not derivation.** Deriving device keys from a
common root would reintroduce the seed-shaped single point of failure
that MPS-0018's seedlessness goal excludes, and would make one device's
compromise a fleet event. Independent keys make `remove_device` and the
epoch mechanism meaningful: revocation removes exactly one credential,
and recovery invalidates all of them (AUTH-6, AUTH-7).

      `midnight:account:auth:v1:*`) registered under the MPS-0027
      registry once it ratifies.
- [ ] A specified and reviewed FROST ciphersuite for JubJub with the
      section 5 challenge (section 7), with a demonstration that a
      `t`-of-`n` committee's aggregated signature verifies against an
      unmodified conforming contract.
- [ ] A public reference implementation passing the conformance suite
      (Testing section), integrated with a custody-MIP-conforming
      contract (both seams in one deployment).
- [ ] Cross-implementation interoperability: a signature produced by
      an independent second signer implementation accepted by the
      reference contract (the TypeScript and Rust reference signers
      already demonstrate this pairwise).
- [ ] Deployment exercised on a public test network.

### Implementation Plan

1. Extract the reference contract and the two reference signers from
   the validation experiments into a reference implementation against
   the custody MIP's contract surface.
2. Commission the cryptographer review; fold findings into the
   specification before editor numbering if substantive.
3. Specify the FROST ciphersuite with the threshold-library maintainers
   and run the committee demonstration.
4. Register domain-separation tags when the MPS-0027 registry lands.
5. Submit for editor numbering; iterate through community commentary.
6. Author the recovery-paths MIP against the section 8 seam.

## Backwards Compatibility Assessment

This MIP introduces a new contract standard. It requires no ledger,
consensus, or node change and no hard fork: every mechanism used
(in-circuit JubJub arithmetic, in-circuit hashing, contract state,
witness-supplied arguments) exists in the current stable network
protocol. It composes with, and requires, the custody MIP; deployments
of the custody surface under other seam instantiations (including
hash-preimage placeholders) remain valid custody-MIP citizens but do
not conform to this standard. MIP-0003 wallet keys and address
derivation are unaffected. Wallets unaware of this standard are
unaffected.

## Security Considerations

- **S1. Nonce reuse and bias.** Reusing the Schnorr nonce `r` across
  two distinct challenges reveals the private key algebraically, and
  biased nonces admit lattice recovery. Signers MUST follow section
  5.3: unique, unpredictable nonces, with hedged deterministic
  derivation recommended. Threshold devices inherit FROST's
  nonce-commitment discipline (RFC 9591), whose one-time nonces MUST
  NOT be reused across signing sessions.
- **S2. Point validation.** JubJub has cofactor 8. `pk` and `sig_r`
  enter the circuit as `JubjubPoint` values; conforming contracts MUST
  ensure both are validated on-curve, and the review under Path to
  Active MUST confirm the subgroup semantics of the built-in operations
  — in particular that a small-order or mixed-order component in
  `sig_r` or a registered `pk` cannot make the section 4 equation
  accept a signature the key holder did not produce. `add_device`
  SHOULD reject keys outside the prime-order subgroup.
- **S3. Non-standard challenge hash.** The SHA-256 Fiat–Shamir
  substitution (R3) means this scheme's security argument does not
  inherit RedJubjub's deployment history. The cryptographer review is
  the control; until it concludes, the scheme's status is
  experimentally validated, not reviewed.
- **S4. Device linkability.** The ledger lookup of step 1 (section 4)
  discloses the acting device's commitment per gated call, linking an
  account's operations by device. This is a known, bounded metadata
  leak on top of the custody MIP's activity metadata (its S4): it
  reveals which credential acted, never the operation's contents. A
  membership proof over a commitment accumulator would hide it and is
  a permitted extension.
- **S5. Key compromise.** Any active device is sufficient to authorise
  (1-of-n), so a compromised device is full compromise of asset
  release until removed. The response surface is `remove_device` from
  a surviving device, the epoch bump on recovery (AUTH-6), and — for
  holdings warranting it — a threshold device (section 7), which turns
  single-device compromise into a `t−1`-share non-event. Note the
  asymmetry with the custody MIP's S2: the encryption secret leaks
  reading, a device key leaks spending; the two are deliberately
  different secrets.
- **S6. Delegated proving is bounded, not trustless.** A prover given
  a signature can execute the approved call or withhold it, and it
  sees the circuit's other witnesses — for a shielded withdrawal, the
  coin description being spent. Signature-based authorisation removes
  the *credential* from the proving environment (AUTH-4); it does not
  make the prover blind. Delegation choices should weigh MPS-0004's
  analysis.
- **S7. Add-device channel.** `add_device` grants full authority to
  the holder of the added key. The gated circuit authenticates *who
  authorised the addition*, not *whose key is added*; clients MUST
  present the new key's provenance to the approving device
  out-of-band (section 6). A poisoned addition is recoverable by
  `remove_device` or epoch bump, minus whatever it authorised
  meanwhile.
- **S8. Signer-side channels.** Scalar multiplication and nonce
  handling on the signer MUST be constant-time in secret inputs, per
  standard Schnorr practice. The grinding loop of 5.2 iterates a hash
  over signer-known data; its iteration count is independent of the
  private key and leaks nothing about it, and its expected ~17.5
  SHA-256 evaluations are negligible even on constrained hardware,
  where SHA-256 support is near-universal.
- **S9. Cross-context replay.** AUTH-2 and AUTH-3 close replay within
  and across accounts and circuits. Residual contexts are deployments
  sharing a contract address across networks; the network-identifier
  binding of section 5.1 is the mitigation and SHOULD be adopted
  wherever multi-network deployment is plausible.
- **S10. Toolchain hazards.** The reference experiment exposed a
  compact-runtime defect in which `JubjubPoint` equality compiled to
  reference rather than structural equality, silently breaking the
  section 4 comparison off-circuit; it is reported upstream and worked
  around in the experiment. Implementations MUST include the negative
  conformance tests (Testing 2) that catch a verifier which accepts
  everything or rejects everything, and MUST pin toolchain versions
  whose hash outputs are stable, per the custody MIP's S6.

## Implementation

- **Evidence base.** The Schnorr-wallet experiments in the Midnight
  Passport workspace validate the scheme end to end against a devnet
  node: an in-circuit verifier (Compact, the section 4 equation with
  the section 5 challenge shape) gating token release from a
  contract, a TypeScript client, and two independent signers — a Rust
  CLI over the contract's curve parameters, and a pure-Rust client
  built directly on the `midnight-ledger` crates (`midnight-curves`)
  that reproduces key derivation, challenge hashing, signing, and
  verification with no TypeScript, WASM, or npm dependency. The two
  produce interchangeable signatures against the same deployed
  verifier, demonstrating AUTH-4's client-agnostic signing boundary.
  The experimental verifier binds a transaction counter with the
  semantics of `auth_nonce`; it predates this specification and
  differs in known ways (single owner key, no device set or epochs,
  no per-circuit tags, no contract-address binding).
- **Seam fit.** The account-custody prototype validates the device-set,
  epoch, and lifecycle surfaces under a hash-preimage placeholder
  expressly structured so that this MIP's verifier replaces a single
  internal circuit; the custody MIP's section 4 was specified against
  that seam.
- **Threshold path.** An existing audited threshold-signatures library
  (MIT-licensed) implements FROST-style RedDSA signing over JubJub with
  distributed key generation; the FROST profile of section 7 requires
  profiling its ciphersuite to the section 5 challenge (Path to
  Active). Committee operation, participant authentication, and share
  lifecycle are that deployment's concern, not this standard's.
- This MIP contains no implementation code; the artefacts above are
  its evidence base, and the reference implementation is an acceptance
  criterion, to be linked at its public location on submission.

## Testing

Conformance is demonstrated by a suite exercising, against a real node:

1. **Authorisation happy path**: a gated call with a valid signature
   from an active device executes; `auth_nonce` and `round` advance
   (AUTH-1, AUTH-2).
2. **Rejection matrix**: the same call aborts, with no state change,
   under each single fault — wrong `sig_s`; `sig_r` for a different
   challenge; unregistered `pk`; `pk` registered under a stale epoch;
   tampered argument with an otherwise-valid signature; stale
   `auth_nonce`; reused signature after a successful call (AUTH-1,
   AUTH-2, AUTH-3, AUTH-6). This matrix is the guard against a
   vacuously accepting verifier (S10).
3. **Cross-account replay**: one device key registered in two
   accounts; a signature for account one is rejected by account two
   (AUTH-3).
4. **Cross-circuit replay**: a signature for one gated circuit is
   rejected by another gated circuit with an identical argument list
   (AUTH-3, per-circuit tags).
5. **Deposit independence**: a permissionless deposit lands between
   signing and submission; the pending authorisation still executes
   (AUTH-8).
6. **Lifecycle**: add device, authorise from it, remove it, observe
   rejection; last-device removal fails; epoch bump invalidates all
   prior devices in one step (AUTH-5, AUTH-6).
7. **Cross-implementation signing**: a signature produced by an
   independent signer implementation, exercising its own hash and
   curve stack, is accepted (AUTH-4's boundary; already demonstrated
   pairwise by the reference signers).
8. **Threshold signature**: an aggregated `t`-of-`n` FROST signature
   verifies against an unmodified contract (section 7; acceptance
   criterion).
9. **Non-exfiltration audit**: the proving pipeline's inputs for every
   gated call are enumerated and contain no device private key or key
   share (AUTH-4).
