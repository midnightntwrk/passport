## Abstract

Independent wallets and custody contracts need to agree on exactly what
an ECDSA credential signs and what the circuit verifies. A mismatched
hash layer, envelope selector or WebAuthn policy breaks that boundary.
This successor-extension working draft records the current secp256k1
(`k1`) and WebAuthn secp256r1 (`r1`) constructions and proposes bounded
verification obligations. Its value is interoperable approval without
giving the signing key to the prover. It is not yet a complete,
independently implementable standard.

## 1. Scope and conformance delta

[MIP-0013 §10](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-improvement-proposals/blob/main/mips/mip-0013-account-authorisation.md#10-versioning)
permits a successor under a **new or revising MIP**. Numbering versus
amendment is editorial. AUTH-1 explicitly requires Schnorr: ECDSA routes
therefore require a conformance delta, replacing its signature relation,
key encodings and challenge construction with those below.

Device routes MUST preserve active-epoch membership, single-use entry
rolling, account-nonce advancement, last-device protection and atomic
abort. This preserves state invariants rather than MIP-0013's literal
gate order: the r1 reference computes the challenge and verifies before
rolling the entry. Mixed-scheme devices share the account's lifecycle
state; scheme-specific commitments distinguish their entries.

A scheme does not confer device or grant authority. Viewing and recovery
are separate capabilities. Grant lifecycle, scope and replay rules belong
to the [scoped-grants companion](mip-xxxx-scoped-grants.md).

MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD and MAY use RFC 2119 meanings. Requirements below
are proposed obligations; reference recipes describe existing bytes.

## 2. Reference signing bytes

Here `H` is SHA-256 and `||` is byte concatenation. `pad(w, tag)` is
ASCII without embedded NUL, followed by zero bytes to exactly width `w`;
tags MUST fit without truncation. Salt, account address and hashes are
32 bytes. Salt is fresh per account. Coordinates `x`, `y` are canonical
32-byte little-endian integers; `epoch` is LE4 and `counter` is LE8.

### Boot and device commitments

The existing boot/device recipes use **v2** for both ECDSA schemes:

```text
k1_boot   = H(pad(32, "midnight:account:boot:k1:v2") || salt || x || y || envelope)
k1_device = H(pad(32, "midnight:account:device:k1:v2") || account || x || y || envelope || epoch || counter)
r1_boot   = H(pad(32, "midnight:account:boot:r1:v2") || salt || x || y || rpIdHash || origin)
r1_device = H(pad(32, "midnight:account:device:r1:v2") || account || x || y || rpIdHash || origin || epoch || counter)
```

`envelope` is one byte (`Uint<8>`). `rpIdHash` is 32 bytes; `origin` is
the exact origin bytes, 21 bytes in the current reference profile.
Signed origins are never padded. These recipes bind the k1 envelope
and r1 RP/origin policy to the credential.

Sources: [k1 commitments](../../../contract/contracts/account.compact#L439-L503),
[r1 commitments](../../../contract/contracts/account-p256.compact#L28-L45).

### Device-operation challenge

Operation tags retain `midnight:account:auth:k1:v1:<operation>` and
`midnight:account:auth:r1:v1:<operation>`. The shared device-route schema is:

```text
dst = H(pad(64, operation_tag))
c   = H(dst || account || x || y || encode(operation_values) || auth_nonce_LE8)
```

The first element is the **32-byte tag hash**, not the padded tag.
`encode(operation_values)` denotes the operation's typed Compact
encoding, including consumed witness values in the specified order.
The circuit MUST recompute `c` from the actual consumed inputs and the
pre-increment account nonce.
Consumed private values MUST be bound even when secret; the exclusion
is authorising material, not all secrets. A digest may substitute for
declared operation values only when the circuit recomputes it from
those values, as `issue_grant` does for its scope digest. ECDSA
challenges contain neither signature material nor a grinding nonce.

This schema is not a complete per-operation serialization specification.
The specification work in section 6 must supply all types, widths,
ordering and independent vectors, including native Fields and points.
Current recipes are in [k1 challenge builders](../../../contract/contracts/account.compact#L712)
and [r1 builders](../../../contract/contracts/account-p256.compact#L74-L174);
[grant issuance](../../../contract/contracts/account-p256.compact#L224-L241)
shows the recomputed-digest substitution.

Grantee calls use their own challenge domain and state. The
[r1 grant builder](../../../contract/contracts/account-p256.compact#L278-L313)
hashes, in order, the padded-tag hash, account, x, y, grant ID,
`issued_at` (`Uint<64>`, LE8), typed operation inputs including consumed
witnesses, and `g.nonce` (LE8). `issued_at` is not the 32-bit revocation
generation. Grantee calls do not consume a device entry or use device
`auth_nonce`; the companion specifies their authorisation rules.

### Digest passed to ECDSA verification

- **k1 envelope 0:** `H(c)`.
- **k1 envelope 1:** `H(ASCII("midnight_signed_message:32:") || c)`;
  the prefix is exactly **27 bytes**. Unknown selectors are rejected.
- **r1:** `H(authenticatorData || H(exact clientDataJSON))`, with the
  WebAuthn challenge equal to `c`, encoded as 43 unpadded base64url
  characters in client data.

k1 **never verifies the raw challenge directly**. Its authorisation
API carries the enrolled envelope selector. See
[digest construction](../../../contract/contracts/account.compact#L541-L547),
[gate](../../../contract/contracts/account.compact#L881-L907),
[wallet signer](../../../contract/src/wallet/signer.ts#L278-L350) and
[independent raw-challenge rejection](../../../contract/src/tests/unit-offline.ts#L324-L339).

Both schemes MUST enforce canonical coordinates in the curve's base
field, on-curve non-identity keys and canonical scalars `1 <= r,s < n`.
Verification interprets the digest
big-endian modulo the curve order, rejects an identity result, and
checks `R.x mod n == r`. Both high-S and low-S are accepted. Equivalent
signatures remain bound to the same single execution by replay state;
signature bytes are private authorising material, not operation IDs.

## 3. Bounded WebAuthn verification

Named, versioned, bounded profiles are permitted. Each MUST declare
accepted forms and byte lengths, required fields and boundary checks,
flag/extension rules, wire-to-circuit conversions and conformance
vectors. Wallet and contract MUST establish compatible capabilities
before enrolment or grant issuance.

Every r1 gate MUST enforce in-circuit:

1. The authorised key, recomputed operation challenge, `webauthn.get`
   type, challenge encoding, and expected RP hash and signed origin.
   RP/origin policy comes from authenticated configuration or credential
   binding, never unchecked prover input. For grants, the signed origin
   must also match the companion's committed `origin_hash`.
2. User presence and the authorised UV policy, together with declared
   flags, cross-origin/top-origin and extension rules, including
   BS-implies-BE. The signed authenticator header is RP hash32, flags1,
   signCount4 (big-endian). Any accepted suffix requires specified checks.
3. Both hash layers over the **complete, exact signed bytes** and ECDSA
   verification. Fixed-shape reconstruction is permitted if every byte
   is constrained. Buffered implementations MUST constrain logical
   lengths and exclude unused capacity. Hashes, offsets and lengths
   supplied as advice MUST be independently constrained.

A full-envelope profile constrains its entire accepted serialization.
A profile using the
[W3C limited-verification algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-3/#clientdatajson-verification)
MUST identify that algorithm and enforce its field/boundary checks
while hashing the full message. It does not establish arbitrary
trailing JSON syntax; profiles MUST state that suffix guarantee
accurately. Wallet-side parsing adds no proof guarantee. Unsupported
assertions MUST be rejected, never truncated, reserialized or padded
to fit.

**Downgrade protection:** every reachable verifier accepting a credential
MUST enforce its authorised policy. One installed verifier is insufficient
if a weaker sibling accepts the same credential. A single immutable
profile, a common enforced floor or authenticated routing may suffice;
otherwise credential/routing binding is required. This does not mandate
a stored profile ID. Updates MUST preserve policy or use an authorised
policy-change procedure.

**UV recommendation:** UP+UV on every WebAuthn gate is the simplest policy
and matches the reference. This recommendation is not an adopted common
floor. Requiring UV only for asset release leaves UP-only `add_device`,
`issue_grant` or recovery-authority replacement able to enable indirect
spending; any weaker proposal must address that escalation.

`signCount` is signed but MUST NOT supply account replay protection;
device/grant state supplies it. ES256 verification does not establish
hardware custody, device binding or a particular biometric.

## 4. Current evidence and its limits

Compact 0.35 provides native P-256 verification. The
[reference `wa-json134` profile](../../../contract/WEBAUTHN.md#supported-profile-wa-json134)
accepts exactly 134-byte client JSON, a 21-byte origin and 37-byte
authenticator data: fixed field order and punctuation, unescaped ASCII
origin, `crossOrigin:false`, no extra members or extensions, and flags
5, 13 or 29 (UP+UV). It is
implementation-specific evidence, not an adopted W3C or MIP baseline.
The [verifier](../../../contract/contracts/webauthn.compact) and
[independent recipe checks](../../../contract/src/tests/p256-offline.ts)
document that construction.

One [live Safari localhost account-key rotation](../../../contract/evidence/p256-webauthn/browser-flow.md)
was accepted. This is separate from software fixtures, grant tests and
caller-binding validation; it establishes no broader browser coverage.
Local runtime malformed-key negatives do not demonstrate native proof
constraints. Key-admissibility enforcement still needs the review below.

The standalone #179 bounded256/origin96 experiment saved **zero** proof
or verifier-key bytes (6,364/2,745 unchanged), with 8.9× rows and 8.1×
prover-key bytes. Its fee-unbalanced software proofs were verified in
memory, not node-accepted account calls; see
[pinned findings](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/passport/blob/cd08b4b104668833654a7de3b2a96f252b38f950/experiments/webauthn-variable-json/FINDINGS.md).

The reference's specialised circuits use a **15,000-verifier-byte
deployment-wave budget**; implementation costs are recorded in
[P256-MEASUREMENTS](../../../contract/P256-MEASUREMENTS.md).

## 5. Compatibility

Existing bytes remain the reference recipes. Changing a committed
preimage requires explicit versioning and migration; profile metadata
cannot silently change it. This draft sets no k1 retirement policy.

[MIP-0021](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-improvement-proposals/blob/main/mips/mip-0021-domain-separation.md)
is Proposed and explicitly rejects a central registry. Existing zero
padding, colon-version tags and underscore operation names conflict with
its convention. Editors must reconcile these constructions without
silently migrating cryptographic bytes.

## 6. Remaining specification decisions

| Item | Required resolution |
|---|---|
| Complete signing recipes | Pin per-operation typed encodings and link existing byte-exact vectors; identify any uncovered cases. |
| Security policy | Decide the common UV floor and specify authorised policy binding across verifier routes without prescribing storage layout. |
| k1 support | Continued coexistence is recommended; justify any retirement using actual consumer and migration evidence, not P-256 availability alone. |
| Review | Map key/scalar admissibility, profile boundary guarantees and the high-S/replay argument to enforcing layers and pinned versions; retain unresolved cryptographic questions explicitly. |
| Editorial alignment | Agree successor versus amendment and reconcile MIP-0021 tags with explicit compatibility treatment. |
